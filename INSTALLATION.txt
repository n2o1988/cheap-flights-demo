Installation Notes.

## Web Server Apache 

for processing requests to the "proxy.php" script, located in /server folder. 
It is also possible to use an external proxy, by changing the url in the "RyanairConfig" service, located in
/src/app/common/ryanair.config.js

There you can find other configurations the user can make. 

## Installation

1. Install Node.js
2. Clone the repo and enter cheap-flights-demo directory
3. Make sure to install bower and grunt (npm -g install grunt-cli bower)
4. npm install
5. bower install
6. grunt build
7. drop the newly created folder "build" under your apache (or other) web service


## Dist

The dist/ folder contains the result of the "grunt build" command, so it is ready to go


## Notes

For some strange reasons the "compile" task I was setting up to minify and optimize the sources is not working. 
I will further investigate on the possible reasons. In the meantime, you should be aware that the "build" folder contains 
all the sources, un-minified.
