# cheap-flights-demo
This is a demo project for a front-end development challenge at Ryanair Labs. 
It consists of a small web app using the live Ryanair API for cheap flight information. The web app is made of the following components:

- A form which allows a user to choose an origin, a destination, and a date period. 
- When a button is pressed, a component which shows all the information relating to the cheapest flight between those points, for the chosen date period
